			<p style="min-width:300px;max-width:500px"><b>Brief History</b><br><br>I was three when I first touched a game controller. Since then, I have fell in love with video games and the process that goes into creating them. It wasn't until the beginning of 2017 when I first got my Windows Mixed Reality Headset and Controllers that I fell in love with the idea of Virtual Reality games. I later invested some more money into VR gear, specifically the Valve Index, Knuckles, and some Full-Body Trackers.</p>

			<p style="min-width:300px;max-width:500px"><b>Hobbies and Interests</b><br><br>In my free time, I usually try and find random little things to do. More often than not that ends up just being random YouTube videos of niche topics. But when it's not, I'll either be 3D Modeling, working on something in Unity, looking at code snippits, or playing games. I also frequently listen to music, usually Pop or Alternative.</p>
